Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory, for example:

Copying garbage collection, Cheney's algorithm
Finding the shortest path between two nodes u and v, with path length measured by number of edges (an advantage over depth-first search)[10]
(Reverse) Cuthill–McKee mesh numbering
Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network
Serialization/Deserialization of a binary tree vs serialization in sorted order, allows the tree to be re-constructed in an efficient manner.
Construction of the failure function of the Aho-Corasick pattern matcher.
Testing bipartiteness of a graph.


Steps:
- visit all nodes, reachable from given step
